### Common components folder-structure

* This folder contains common components that can be reused anywhere in the rest of the site.
* These components have their own style which is based on the assets provided by the designer.
* One way to improve these components would be to have the styles passed in as props so that the styling of the components can be changed depending on where they are used. This will increase the reusability of the components.
